SETUP
	you might want to setup an environment variable %oeini% to automatically pass an ini file to
	ablt.bat. You can to that with the following command as administrator:

	```
		setx /M oeini "<path-to-ini-file>"
	```

	you also may want to setup a environment variable to automatically pass some defaults procedures
	when executing the ablt.bat. In this case, you will setup %oedcs%:

	```
		setx /M oedcs "<path-to-scripts>"
	```
	
	**IMPORTANT**: if some procedure is not found by the program, it is ignored and the program
	continues its normal execution

	you can define default `.pf` file as well:

	```
		setx /M oedpf "<path-to-pf-file>"
	```
